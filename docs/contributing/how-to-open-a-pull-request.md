title: How to Open a Pull Request
---

A big part of contributing to open source is submitting changes to a project: improvements to source code or tests, updates to docs content, even typos or broken links. This doc will cover what you need to know to **open a pull request** in Gatsby.

## What is a Pull Request (PR)?

In case you aren't familiar, here's how the fine folks at GitHub [define a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests):

> Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

Gatsby uses the pull request process to review and test changes before they’re added to Gatsby’s GitHub repository. Anyone can open a pull request. The same process is used for all contributors, whether this is your first open source contribution or you’re a core member of the Gatsby team.

Simply put, when someone wants to contribute to Gatsby, they open a request to _pull_ their code into ours. Depending on the type of change, we like to categorize pull requests (or PRs for short) into:

- Documentation
- Code
- Starters or Site Showcase
- Blog posts

Recommendations for different kinds of contributions will follow in this guide and throughout the contributing docs.

## Things to know before opening a PR

We typically recommend [opening an issue](/contributing/how-to-file-an-issue/) before a pull request if there isn't already an issue for the problem you'd like to solve. This helps facilitate a discussion before deciding on an implementation.

For some PRs, such as typo fixes or broken links, it may be faster to go straight to a PR: this is somewhat subjective, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask us on Twitter, Discord, or in a GitHub issue.

## Opening PRs in Gatsby

Depending on the nature of the change, your options for [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) will vary slightly.

### Docs PRs

The Gatsby.js docs site mostly lives in the [www](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/www) and [docs](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/docs) directories on GitHub, including docs and tutorial content. There are also some [examples](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples) in the repo that are referenced in the docs.

Docs changes can be initiated through the command-line using git or the GitHub UI. Further instructions can be found on the [docs contributions](/contributing/docs-contributions/) page.

### Code PRs

Instructions for making changes to the Gatsby source code, tests, internals, APIs, packages, and more can be found on the [code contributions](/contributing/code-contributions/) page.

### Starters or Site Showcase

There are specific pages about contributing to various parts of the Gatsby ecosystem:

- [showcase submissions](/contributing/site-showcase-submissions/)
- [Starter library](/contributing/submit-to-starter-library/)

### Blog posts

For the Gatsby blog, it's necessary to run your content idea by the Gatsby team before submitting it. For more information, refer to the page on [blog and website contributions](/contributing/blog-and-website-contributions/).
